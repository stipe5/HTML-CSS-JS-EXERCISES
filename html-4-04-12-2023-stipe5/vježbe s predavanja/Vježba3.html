                    <p>Due to the accompanying bays, islands and rich undersea, it is a real challenge for divers and sport fishermen. The undulating plateau in the central part of the island is streaked with tens of kilometres of hiking and biking trails, and the colours, scents and panorama are an unforgettable picture for every passer-by. In addition to being ideal for swimming, sunbathing and gastronomic delights, the island Ugljan also offers many opportunities for an active holiday.</p>

                    <p>
                        This is a project within which olive and cycling paths were set up and mapped, rest areas and lookouts were built in the most attractive areas in the hinterland of the island. The project is also accompanied by a new cycling map and a mobile app. Now there are more than 100 kilometres of cycling and hiking paths on the island with different themes and two trail paths.
                        Enjoy the untouched nature of the island's rocky landscape, richly covered with vegetation of indigenous Dalmatian herbs, holm oak, attractive strawberry trees with red sweet fruits, myrtle, terebinth, with landscaped olive groves with predominant indigenous olive species.
